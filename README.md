# psypsy
An attempt for psychological experiments

# ToDo
- [X] shuffle.py: randomisation with constraints
- [ ] gifpygame.py: allow animated gif in pygame

# Gemination AXB task

## Installation:
    1. Install all requirements
        * cd ~/Dropbox/Non-Native\ perception\ of\ geminates/gemination_axb
        * bash install.sh

## AXB experiments:

    1. Randomization (under development)
        * training and axb trial files should be placed in "list_trial" folder
        * the name of files should be:
            - training_**.csv (** replaced by number with two digits)
            - Example: training_00.csv, training_01.csv, training_02.csv ...
            - axb_**.csv (** replaced by number with two digits)
            - Example: axb_00.csv, axb_01.csv, axb_02.csv ...

    2. Launch experiment    
        * cd ~/Dropbox/Non-Native\ perception\ of\ geminates/gemination_axb
        * python3 gemination_axb.py [subjNÂ° in two digits]
          Example: python3 axb_experiment.py 00
                   python3 axb_experiment.py 01
                   etc.

    3. Description of Experiment
        3.1. display instruction of training
            * click <space> when finish reading instruction to continue
        3.2. training session
        3.3. display instruction of AXB
            * click <space> when finish reading instruction to continue
        3.4. AXB session
            * trial_list.csv contains 192 trials
                - participants will have one breaks at 96th trial
                - No limite of time for breaks
                - once finish the break, click <space> to continue
        3.5. Results
            * result files are in the "result_axb" folder
            * result is append to "result_total" file with subject number when experiment is finished
            * the response time is given both in absolute value (from the beginning of the excution of program) and in relative value (response time - start of sound B) 
                * if response before B: negative value
                * if response after B: positive value

    4. Experiment parameters
        * Response A: left shift
        * Response B: right shift
        * ISI 1000ms
        * Limit of response time: 2s after the end of sound B
        * the experiment can be stopped any time by clicking ESC
        * background color ([0,0,0] for black and [255,255,255] for white)
